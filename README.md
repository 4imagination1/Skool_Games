Adding a Game

1. Create a fork of this repository.
2. On your computer create a folder, the folder should be the full name of the game with one "-" (Dash) between each word (no letters capitalized).
3. In the folder upload the games "index.html" file to the folder (if the games html file isnt named index rename it).
4. Rename the games image to "icon" then upload it (make sure it has the .jpg file extension if it doesnt use an online converter)
